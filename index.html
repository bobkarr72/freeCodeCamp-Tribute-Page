      <h3 id="headline">Here is why Ms. Spencer is the prettiest (and coolest and weirdest and funniest) 'Cat Lady':
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reason #1</strong> - She was born in Massachussetts & those people are strange right-off-the-bat.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reason #2</strong> - Her mom is into all that "Jesus stuff" and her dad is a Vietnam vet who also
          rides Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Emma was destined to be one-of-a-kind!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reason #3</strong> - Growing up, Emma had a lot of friends, but she was in more pictures than her
          other friends, so obviously people liked her the most!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reason #4</strong> - Wanna' know why people like Emmma so much? Because 'Emma Is Super!'
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reason #5</strong> - Emma has very peculiar sense-of-humor that is wise beyond her age. She also has
          empathy in the way that cats exude empathy. Which is to say, she (and they) will only extend it so far before
          they'd rather just claw your eyes out & laugh while you run around blind & bleeding.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reason #6</strong> - Emma is also the prettiest. Emma doesn't think that she's the prettiest. But what
          she doesn't know is that I & other people see her and think she's pretty, even the prettiest, so until she
          figures it out, at least the rest of us have!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reason #7</strong> - Emma does not like to wake up until she's ready to wake up....and even when she
          does wake up, she is going to wake up on her own terms. Don't even think about trying to alter this paradigm
          or you might not live to see the end of the day. I don't know what this has to do with the main thesis of this
          project but if anyone ever reads this, at least I gave you a warning.
        </li>
      </ul>
